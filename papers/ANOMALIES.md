## A1 — Covariance-matched nulls are unusable in massive-activation families without robustification

**Date:** 2026-07-01 · **Found in:** Direction-2 chunk-1 B1/B3 (`d2_decision_coupling`), cross-model
panel OLMo-3 / Qwen2.5-7B / Llama-3.1-8B (instruct).

**Observation.** The covariance-matched rank-matched null (draw random directions from `N(0, Σ̂)`
of residual activations, project onto the rank-`r` subspace) — the honest null used throughout
Papers 5–7 and D1 — **saturates** on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.1: R2 null q95 = 0.92 (Qwen) / 0.36
(Llama), R3 pairwise-null q95 = 0.995 (Qwen) / 0.90 (Llama), versus 0.26 on OLMo-3. At a saturated
null every direction "projects like a typical direction," so the test has no discriminating power —
exactly the degeneracy d1 documented for eff-dim-385, here from a different cause.

**Mechanism.** Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.1 carry **massive-activation outlier dimensions** (Qwen dim 458
= **59%** of residual variance; Llama dim 788 = **32%**; OLMo-3's top dim = 1.4%). `Σ̂` is dominated
by these dims, so covariance-matched random directions nearly all align with them and project ~1
onto any subspace with a component there. The same dims dominate raw mean-diff directions, collapsing
distinct constructs (Qwen ethics≈moral mean-diff `|cos|` = 0.90). This is the known
**massive-activations / attention-sink** phenomenon (e.g. Sun et al. 2024, *Massive Activations in
Large Language Models*; Xiao et al. 2023, *Efficient Streaming LMs with Attention Sinks* — verify
exact refs before citing in a paper). OLMo-3's well-conditioned activations are why every OLMo-based
result in Papers 1–7 / D1 was clean.

**Fix (pre-registered, `d2_decision_coupling/PREREGISTRATION.md` Amendment 1).** Recompute
directions + the null in a **per-dimension-standardized** space (z-score by σ from a format/position-
matched `act_sample` with sink tokens excluded); primary. Robustness variant: **project out
dimensions individually > 5% of variance** (criterion-based). Legitimacy proof: the clean instrument
(OLMo) must give the **same verdict** raw→standardized. Behavioral results (ablation, judgment
accuracy) do not use the null and are untouched; only geometric cells need the re-audit.

**Affects.** Any direction-geometry projection-fraction / cosine-null computed on Qwen or Llama
family activations, including **Paper 6's cross-model geometric cells** (back-audit pre-registered)
and Direction-2 R2/R3/R5/R8 for Qwen/Llama. Does **not** affect OLMo-based numbers.

**Why it's a contribution.** "Covariance-matched nulls silently degenerate in massive-activation
families" is a portable caution for anyone building moral/refusal/concept subspaces and testing them
against activation-space nulls on Llama/Qwen — the field's default panel. It belongs in the methods
section, not a footnote.
